[00:10.96] This is like a private plane up on my ring
[00:14.25] This is like the first time I bought a chain
[00:16.76] This is like when I was sane, before the fame
[00:19.62] Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
[00:35.12] 
[00:22.49] This is like another thing I can't explain
[00:25.23] This is like the summer flame that got away
[00:27.95] I won't let another angel go to waste
[00:30.84] Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
[00:46.34] 
[00:33.99] Oh
[00:34.53] Vividus bed where I'm layin' my head
[00:37.22] Devil on my back so I sleep on my chest
[00:40.14] Waitin' at the gate how'd they get my address?
[00:42.70] On my last nerve while I'm rippin' cigarettes
[01:05.20] 
[00:45.68] It's a killer I know, it's a killer I know
[00:48.47] I just need a lil' somethin' get me through the day
[00:51.02] Yeah my mind is blank or I overthink
[00:53.83] It's gettin' old but it's nothin' new
[01:12.33] 
[00:56.32] I say your name when you're not around
[00:58.81] When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up
[01:01.69] Need to say your name when you're not around
[01:04.51] When I'm drunk and my knees can't pick me up
[01:26.51] 
[01:07.73] This is like a private plane up on my ring
[01:10.67] This is like the first time I bought a chain
[01:13.35] This is like when I was sane, before the fame
[01:16.02] Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
[01:31.52] 
[01:18.92] This is like another thing I can't explain
[01:21.78] This is like the summer flame that got away
[01:24.89] I won't let another angel go to waste
[01:27.50] Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
[01:43.00] 
[01:30.43] I blacked out left a hundred missed calls on your phone
[01:33.56] I mixed my drink with a couple of drugs
[01:36.16] Spit in my face now you hate that I'm gone babe
[01:39.99] You're doin' the most
[01:50.49] 
[01:41.22] I don't need somebody to be the one to keep me honest
[01:46.58] I don't wanna know the truth, I can't fight if I'm alone
[01:50.88] I need enemies
[01:52.56] You know how far that I will go
[01:56.93] Every road takes its toll
[01:59.73] Before you leave, I'm gone, I'm gone
[02:17.73] 
[02:04.24] This is like a private plane up on my ring
[02:06.87] This is like the first time I bought a chain
[02:09.66] This is like when I was sane, before the fame
[02:12.59] Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
[02:28.09] 
[02:15.49] This is like another thing I can't explain
[02:18.33] This is like the summer flame that got away
[02:21.26] I won't let another angel go to waste
[02:23.90] Uh oh uh oh, this life is crazy
[02:39.40] 
[02:35.67] I should listen to you now, if I never have
[02:41.38] I should listen to you now, if I never have
[02:46.91] I should listen to you now, if I never have
[02:52.77] I should listen to you now, if I never have
[02:58.40] I should listen to you now, if I never have
[03:03.75] I should listen to you now, if I never have
[03:09.54] I should listen to you now
